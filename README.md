Healthy Cook's Club
This project was designed to give beginner and expert cooks alike a place to share, comment, and learn how to make 
new and interesting meals while keeping a healthy body in mind. Users will be able to upload, edit, and critique each other 
on either their own original recipes or ones that they've picked up along the way. 

All too often we get caught up trying to figure out what recipes work best for our bodies, how many days of left overs we
we will have, and what can be cooked in a convenient and timely manner; and it's usually on our own. 
But with this application, users will have access to a community of like-minded individuals to walk this journey with.
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cooked, there is something here for you. Users can learn, teach, collaborate,
critique, ask questions, etc. The point is, you don't have to do this alone anymore.

UX
My process for this project was to follow along with the code I learned in a lesson. I put my own take on it so I could 
actually learn what was being taught. 


As a user, I want to learn, make friends, and open my mind to new recipes.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of 
the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself 
(in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
The first feature is the New Recipe feature. This is the main attraction. This is what's going to allow the community to
share their ideas with the world.
The edit feature was originally intended to restricted to be used by the recipe creator via log in. But due to time 
constraints, I decided just to implement the basic functionality so you could get an idea of what it could look like.
The search feature is was created to do just as you would think. Search. I gave three options to pick from, being breakfast,
lunch, and dinner. It was intended to bring you to all existing recipes within that category but I also cut this short
due to time constraints. Leaving only the option to choose but it leads no where. 
The rate feature is designed to let users review, critique, and share their personal experience with the shared
recipe. I intended for there to be a comment feature as well but due to time constraints I also had to cut this short. 
Two features completely left out were the log in and create user features. These features were intended to restrict recipe
creation, editing, and deletion to the user that created it. It was also designed to give the rating and comment system
some legitamacy. Only those that took the time to sign up can comment so that ratings, comments, etc. don't get skewed
by any uninvested viewer just passing by whether their intentions were ill or not. I also added a carrot icon
to imply that the meal is vegan.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Deployment
I deployed the project to github and heroku. 
There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version other than the development version
can be modified further.

I was inspired by code from w3 schools to implement the search functionality. 
I was inspired by code from the task manager lesson for the basic outline of the website.
I was also inspired by a YouTube video created by a user named Online Tutorials for the star rating functionality
